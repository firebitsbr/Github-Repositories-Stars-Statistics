# Github Repositories Stargazers Statistics

This notebook gets current stargazers for some repositories and then it views the daily stargazers report within a specific range.

Repositories with 50000 stars or more than should be excluded, because Github API won't return all that data in this case.

### Notebook inputs:

- List of repositories names in the format: username/rep_name
- Start date
- End date
- Also your Github username and password should be included.

### Output example:
